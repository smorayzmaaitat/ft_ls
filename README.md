# ft_ls

The `ft_ls` project is a reimplementation of the Unix `ls` command, developed as part of the 42 Network curriculum. This project aims to deepen understanding of filesystem structures, system calls, and command-line parsing by replicating `ls`'s core functionality and common flags.

## Features

* Lists files and directories with sorting options
* Supports flags like:
  * `-a`: show hidden files
  * `-l`: display detailed file info (permissions, size, etc.)
  * `-R`: recursive listing of directories and subdirectories
  * `-t`: sort by modification time
* Handles symbolic links, various file types, and different sorting options

This project emphasizes low-level C programming, memory management, and mastery of file system interactions.
